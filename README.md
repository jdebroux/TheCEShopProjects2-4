# The CE Shop Interview Project 2-4

### Additional Practical Interview Questions:
1) How would you make an application testable, what do you do to ensure code quality?
   - To make an application testable, I would:
     - use a test framework to create automated tests
     - use interfaces to replace dependencies with test doubles
     - separate concerns by breaking the application into smaller parts to test more specified code pieces
     - write unit tests and integration tests
   - To ensure code quality, I would recommend the following practices:
     - code reviews to spread knowledge within the team and find potential bugs
     - create automated testing to reduce the possibility of code changes resulting in creating bugs or breaking the app
     - consistent formatting so the code is consistent and readable
     - monitor the application in production to ensure things are running as expected and if not they can be identified and resolved quickly

2) From a software development perspective, what steps might you take, on an ongoing basis, to continually improve your skill set?
    - As a software engineer I can continually be improving my skill set by:
      - staying up to date with the latest technologies and industry trends.  I typically am reading articles and attending webinars to facilitate this
      - participate in coding challenges and hackathons to keep coding skill sharp and gain exposure to new technologies
      - work on personal projects.  This is one of my favorite ways to keep my skills sharp.  It's fun and helps me better stay in contact with industry friends
      - take online courses/read industry books or documentation.  Clean Code and Clean Architecture are a couple of my favorites so far.

3) Provide an example of a time when you just couldn't complete all of your work on time to meet a
   deadline. What did you do? What was the result?
    - During my time at Zoom, I collaborated extensively with both our product and user experience teams to enhance the email and notification systems to align with current trends. When alterations in feature expectations posed a risk of missing the deadline, I proactively initiated discussions with the product team to explore any project components that could be postponed until a future sprint. By adjusting the workload, we could prioritize and focus on the most critical tasks to be completed for our users. However, if all deliverables were still required by the end of the sprint, I would have approached my manager to examine whether any other engineers had available bandwidth or less critical work that could be reassigned to meet the deadline.
